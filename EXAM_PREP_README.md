## 📖 Fundamental Concepts

### Q1: What is Linear Regression?

**Answer:** Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a linear equation.

**Mathematical Form:**

- **Simple Linear Regression:** `y = mx + b`
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** `y = w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ + b`

Where:

- `y` = predicted output (target variable)
- `x` = input features
- `m/w` = slope/weights (coefficients)
- `b` = y-intercept (bias)

### Q2: What are the key assumptions of Linear Regression?

**Answer:**

1. **Linearity:** Relationship between features and target is linear
2. **Independence:** Observations are independent of each other
3. **Homoscedasticity:** Constant variance of residuals
4. **Normality:** Residuals are normally distributed
5. **No Multicollinearity:** Features are not highly correlated

### Q3: What is the difference between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression?

**Answer:**

- **Simple Linear Regression:** Uses only ONE feature to predict the target
  - Example: `House Price = m × (House Size) + b`
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Uses MULTIPLE features to predict the target
  - Example: `House Price = w₁×(Size) + w₂×(Bedrooms) + w₃×(Age) + b`

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundation

### Q4: What is the Cost Function in Linear Regression?

**Answer:** The cost function measures how well our model fits the data. We use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:

```
J(θ) = (1/2m) × Σᵢ₌₁ᵐ (ŷᵢ - yᵢ)²

Where:
- J(θ) = cost function
- m = number of training examples
- ŷᵢ = predicted value for example i
- yᵢ = actual value for example i
- θ = parameters (weights and bias)
```

**Why MSE?**

- Penalizes larger errors more heavily (quadratic)
- Differentiable (needed for gradient descent)
- Convex function (single global minimum)

### Q5: Explain Gradient Descent Algorithm

**Answer:** Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm to find the minimum of the cost function.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. Initialize parameters randomly
2. Calculate cost using current parameters
3. Calculate gradients (partial derivatives)
4. Update parameters: `θ = θ - α × ∇J(θ)`
5. Repeat until convergence

**Update Rules:**

```
For Simple Linear Regression:
m = m - α × (1/n) × Σ(ŷᵢ - yᵢ) × xᵢ
b = b - α × (1/n) × Σ(ŷᵢ - yᵢ)

Where α = learning rate
```

### Q6: What is Learning Rate and how does it affect training?

**Answer:** Learning rate (α) controls the step size in gradient descent.

**Effects:**

- **Too High (α > optimal):**
  - Training becomes unstable
  - May overshoot the minimum
  - Cost might increase or oscillate
- **Too Low (α < optimal):**
  - Training is very slow
  - May get stuck in local minima
  - Requires more iterations
- **Optimal α:**
  - Smooth, fast convergence
  - Reaches global minimum efficiently

**Typical values:** 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing

### Q7: Why do we need Data Normalization/Standardization?

**Answer:** Normalization is crucial for gradient descent optimization.

**Problems without normalization:**

- Features have different scales (e.g., age: 20-80, income: 20,000-200,000)
- Gradients have vastly different magnitudes
- Learning rate that works for one feature breaks another
- Slow or unstable convergence

**Solution - Z-score normalization:**

```
z = (x - μ) / σ

Where:
- μ = mean of feature
- σ = standard deviation of feature
- Result: mean = 0, std = 1
```

### Q8: Why did we apply Log Transformation to certain features?

**Answer:** Log transformation reduces **skewness** in data distribution.

**Benefits:**

1. **Converts right-skewed → normal distribution**
2. **Reduces impact of outliers**
3. **Stabilizes variance**
4. **Improves linear regression assumptions**

**When to use:** When features have exponential or power-law distributions (e.g., population, income, house sizes)

**Formula:** `log(x + 1)` (adding 1 prevents log(0))

### Q9: What is Feature Engineering and why is it important?

**Answer:** Feature engineering creates new features from existing ones to improve model performance.

**Examples from our project:**

```python
# New features created:
bedroom_ratio = total_bedrooms / total_rooms
household_rooms = total_rooms / households
```

**Benefits:**

- Captures domain knowledge
- May reveal hidden patterns
- Often improves model accuracy
- Can reduce need for complex models

## 💻 Implementation Details

### Q10: Explain the difference between fit_transform() and transform()

**Answer:**

- **fit_transform():** Learns parameters from training data AND applies transformation
- **transform():** Only applies previously learned transformation (used on test data)

```python
# Training data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)  # Learn mean, std AND scale

# Test data
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)  # Only scale using learned parameters
```

**Why this matters:** Prevents data leakage - test data shouldn't influence preprocessing parameters.

### Q11: What is the purpose of train-test split?

**Answer:** Split data to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

**Typical splits:**

- 70-30, 80-20, 90-10 (train-test)
- 60-20-20 (train-validation-test)

**Why needed:**

- **Training accuracy** can be misleading (overfitting)
- **Test accuracy** shows real-world performance
- **Validates generalization** ability

### Q12: Explain Overfitting vs Underfitting

**Answer:**

**Overfitting:**

- Model learns training data too well (memorizes noise)
- High training accuracy, low test accuracy
- High variance, low bias
- Solutions: Regularization, more data, simpler model

**Underfitting:**

- Model is too simple to capture patterns
- Low training accuracy, low test accuracy
- High bias, low variance
- Solutions: More features, complex model, feature engineering

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

### Q13: Explain different evaluation metrics for regression

**Answer:**

**1. Mean Squared Error (MSE):**

```
MSE = (1/n) × Σ(ŷᵢ - yᵢ)²
```

- Penalizes large errors heavily
- Units: squared units of target variable

**2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**

```
RMSE = √MSE
```

- Same units as target variable
- Easier to interpret

**3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**

```
MAE = (1/n) × Σ|ŷᵢ - yᵢ|
```

- Less sensitive to outliers
- Average absolute deviation

**4. R² Score (Coefficient of Determination):**

```
R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
```

- Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- Proportion of variance explained
- 0.7+ is generally good

### Q14: How do you interpret R² score?

**Answer:**

- **R² = 0.85:** Model explains 85% of variance in target variable
- **R² = 0.0:** Model performs as well as predicting the mean
- **R² < 0:** Model performs worse than predicting the mean

**Example interpretations:**

- R² = 0.95: Excellent fit
- R² = 0.8-0.9: Good fit
- R² = 0.6-0.8: Moderate fit
- R² < 0.6: Poor fit

## ❓ Common Exam Questions

### Q15: Compare your implementation with Scikit-learn

**Answer:** Our gradient descent implementation achieves the same results as scikit-learn's optimized solver.

**Key similarities:**

- Same final parameters (weights and bias)
- Same R² score
- Both minimize MSE cost function

**Differences:**

- **Our implementation:** Uses gradient descent (educational)
- **Scikit-learn:** Uses analytical solution (faster)

### Q16: What would happen if we didn't normalize the data?

**Answer:**

1. **Convergence issues:** Different feature scales cause uneven gradients
2. **Slow training:** May require thousands more iterations
3. **Unstable learning:** Oscillating cost function
4. **Poor performance:** Suboptimal parameter values

### Q17: How would you improve this model?

**Answer:**

1. **More features:** Include all available features
2. **Feature engineering:** Create interaction terms, polynomial features
3. **Regularization:** Ridge/Lasso to prevent overfitting
4. **Cross-validation:** Better performance estimation
5. **Hyperparameter tuning:** Optimize learning rate, iterations
6. **Advanced algorithms:** Try Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

### Q18: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff

**Answer:**

- **Bias:** Error from oversimplifying the model
- **Variance:** Error from sensitivity to small fluctuations
- **Trade-off:** Reducing one often increases the other

**Goal:** Find the sweet spot that minimizes total error = Bias² + Variance + Irreducible Error

### Q19: What is regularization and when would you use it?

**Answer:** Regularization adds penalty terms to prevent overfitting.

**Types:**

- **Ridge (L2):** Adds Σwᵢ² penalty - shrinks coefficients
- **Lasso (L1):** Adds Σ|wᵢ| penalty - can zero out coefficients
- **Elastic Net:** Combines both L1 and L2

**When to use:** When you have many features or model overfits training data.

### Q20: How do you detect if your model is overfitting?

**Answer:**

1. **Training accuracy >> Test accuracy**
2. **Validation curve shows gap**
3. **High variance in cross-validation scores**
4. **Model performs poorly on new data**

**Solutions:**

- More training data
- Feature selection
